Our research focus lies in the analysis of adaptable behavior, the learning process, and decision-making. Our primary objective is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of both human and non-human agents, viewing it as an adaptive response to the statistical structure of their environment. \n Research Topics:\n  Cognitive Bayesian Modeling, Game Theory, Planning, Causality, Computational Psychiatry, Adaptative Behavior, Reinforcement Learning, and Intertemporal Choice   \nWebsite:  Lab 25"

They utilize naturally occurring behavioral data and adopt a solution-oriented approach to empirical science, deriving research questions from real-world problems. Their methodology involves probabilistic generative modeling and Bayesian computational analysis methods.\n Research Topics:\n  Modeling human decision making, Collective cognition and the wisdom of the crowd, Modeling memory with clinical applications, Bayesian statistical methods   \nWebsite:  Michael Lee’s Lab"
